# LSE01
Software to handle Dragino LSE01 soil sensor data transmission via TTN LoRaWAN, MQTT and Node-RED. 

The Dragino LSE01 soil sensor bundle provides soil moisture, soil temperature as well as soil electrical conductivity measurements. It uses LoRaWAN to transmit the data. The control device is a Dragino LSN50 v2 whose hardware is open source. Unfortunately the software turning it into a LSE01 as well as hard- and software of the connected soil sensor are closed source. In the latter case even the brand is unknown. It is unclear how the connected sensor works and how to communicate with it. It is unclear where to purchase the soil sensor separately. So for the time being the sensor kit LSE01 (LSN50 + unknown soil sensor) has to be used as it is.
